# Adding Support for Your Dataset

If you are a **dataset owner** and want your dataset to be loadable via `load_dataset()`, you need to provide a `schema.yaml` file. This document describes how to create one, test it locally, and submit it to the registry.

## Overview

A `schema.yaml` file tells the MDC Python SDK how to interpret the files in your dataset archive. Instead of writing custom parsing code for every dataset, we use these declarative schemas to automatically map your files into a clean **pandas DataFrame**.

## How to create a `schema.yaml`

### Step 1: Inspect your archive

Extract your dataset and understand its file layout. This determines which **strategy** you should use:

- **Index-based**: You have a central metadata file (CSV, TSV, or pipe-delimited) that lists paths to files and their transcriptions/metadata.
- **Multi-split**: You have separate files for each split (e.g., `train.tsv`, `test.tsv`, `dev.tsv`).
- **Multi-sections**: The archive is split into section directories, each with its own index file (e.g., `dataset/General/metadata.tsv`, `dataset/Chat/metadata.tsv`).
- **Paired-glob**: There is no index file; instead, each audio file has a matching sidecar file — a `.txt` transcription with the same name (TTS), or a JSON file holding the audio filename, metadata, and time-aligned utterances (ASR, with `format: "json"`).
- **Glob**: There is no index file or text pairing; metadata is encoded in the directory hierarchy (e.g., `speaker_id/language/utterance.wav`).

### Step 2: Identify the task

Determine which task your dataset belongs to. Datasets on MDC are typically **ASR** (Automatic Speech Recognition), **TTS** (Text-to-Speech), or **OTH** (Other — e.g. speaker verification, language identification).

### Step 3: Write the schema

Create a file named `schema.yaml`. Start with the basic required fields:

```yaml
dataset_id: "your-dataset-id"   # The unique ID of the dataset on MDC
root_strategy: "index"          # index, multi_split, multi_sections, paired_glob, or glob
task: "ASR"                     # e.g. ASR, TTS, or OTH
```

The `task` is used to check that the loaded DataFrame contains
the task's required columns (e.g. ASR/TTS: `audio_path` + `transcription`).
If any are missing, loading emits a `TaskValidationWarning` but still
returns the DataFrame.

Then add the fields for your chosen strategy.

#### Example: Index-based ASR
If your dataset has a `metadata.tsv` file:

```yaml
dataset_id: "your-dataset-id"
root_strategy: "index"
task: "ASR"
index_file: "metadata.tsv"
base_audio_path: "clips/"      # Folder where audio files are located
columns:
  audio_path:
    source_column: "path"      # Name of the column in metadata.tsv
    dtype: "file_path"
  transcription:
    source_column: "sentence"
    dtype: "string"
```

`format` is optional when the loader can infer the separator from
`index_file`. `base_audio_path` can also be a list when audio files may live in
more than one directory.

If your metadata stores IDs instead of directly joinable audio paths, you can
compose the real path from metadata columns declaratively:

```yaml
dataset_id: "your-dataset-id"
root_strategy: "index"
task: "ASR"
index_file: "data/metadata.csv"
base_audio_path: "data/${Split}/"

columns:
  audio_path:
    source_column: "Sentence ID"
    dtype: "file_path"
    file_extension: ".wav"
    path_template: "${Speaker ID}_khm_${value}"
  transcription:
    source_column: "Sentences"
    dtype: "string"
```

The loader replaces `${...}` placeholders using values from the current
metadata row, so this stays generic and avoids hardcoding dataset-specific
Python logic.

### Step 4: Test locally

You can test your schema before submitting it. Place your `schema.yaml` in the folder where you extracted the dataset and run:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from datacollective.schema import _parse_schema
from datacollective.schema_loaders.registry import _load_dataset_from_schema

# Path to your local schema
schema = _parse_schema(Path("path/to/extracted/schema.yaml"))

# Load using the schema
df = _load_dataset_from_schema(schema, extract_dir=Path("path/to/extracted/"))

print(df.head())
```

If the DataFrame looks correct, your schema is ready!

### Step 5: Submit to the registry

Once tested, submit your `schema.yaml` to the [dataset-schema-registry](https://github.com/Mozilla-Data-Collective/dataset-schema-registry) repository. 
Place it under `registry/<your-dataset-id>/schema.yaml`.
